# Turbo-Ontology
Hosts the TURBO Ontology and supporting files.

The TURBO Ontology has migrated to the ODK stucture and makefile. In addition to the turbo-base.owl, turbo-full.owl, and turbo.owl files, the ODK-based files are under the src directory. 

The Penn implementation currently still downloads the turbo ontology from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PennTURBO/turbo-ontology/dev/ontologies/turbo_merged.owl

That version was constructed manually and imports OBO terms with OntoFox and OntoDog. These files are under the ontologies folder.

A ROBOT-based version was under development and its files are also under the ontologies folder.
